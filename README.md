# Credit-Card-Analysis---PowerBI-
 Provide Insights to the Product Strategy Team in the Banking Domain 

 Problem Statment 
Mitron Bank is a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad. They want to introduce a new line of credit cards, aiming to broaden its product offerings and reach in the financial market. 
AtliQ Data Services came to know about this through an internal link and approached Mitron Bank with a proposal to implement this project.
However, the strategy director of Mitron Bank, Mr. Bashnir Rover is skeptical and asked them to do a pilot project with the sample data before handing over them the full project.
They provided a sample dataset of 4000 customers across five cities on their online spending and other details.

Demographic classification: Classify the customers based on available demography such as age group, gender, occupation etc. and provide insights based on them.
Spending Analysis  :Where do people spend money the most? Does it have any impact due to occupation, gender, city, age etc.? This can help you to add relevant credit card features for specific target groups.
Avg income utilisation %: Find the average income utilisation % of customers (avg_spends/avg_income). This will be your key metric. The higher the average income utilisation %, the more is their likelihood to use credit cards.
Key Customer Segments: By doing above, you should be able to identify and profile key customer segments that are likely to be the highest-value users of the new credit cards. This includes understanding their demographics, spending behaviours, and financial preferences.
Credit Card Feature Recommendations: Provide recommendations on what key features should be included in the credit card which will improve the likelihood of credit card usage. This should be backed by the insights from data provided and also some secondary research on the internet for this.
